# 🧠 AI-Powered Natural Language Data Query Assistant

An AI-powered **AI-Powered Natural Language Data Query Assistant
** that allows users to query a SQLite database using natural language.  
The system leverages **Large Language Models (LLMs)** to translate human language into executable SQL queries and return accurate results.

This project demonstrates practical **Generative AI**, **LLM orchestration**, and **database reasoning** skills.

## 🔍 Problem (Business & User Perspective)

Musicians and content creators often lack objective yet creative feedback on:

Tempo, key, and energy

Mood and genre characteristics

Arrangement and production direction

Existing tools are either too technical or disconnected from creative workflows.

## 💡 Solution (What This System Delivers)

This project delivers an end-to-end applied AI music intelligence system that:

Accepts uploaded audio files

Extracts musical and spectral features

Applies machine learning for classification or similarity

Uses a Large Language Model (LLM) to generate musician-friendly insights

## 🧠 System Architecture (End-to-End AI Pipeline)

Audio Input (.wav / .mp3) → Audio Feature Extraction (librosa) → ML Intelligence (classification / embedding) → Generative AI (LLM) → Creative Insights for Musicians

##⚙️ Core Features (Implemented Scope)

Audio upload and preprocessing

Tempo (BPM), duration, loudness analysis

MFCC and Mel-spectrogram extraction

ML-based mood or genre classification

LLM-generated insights:

Mood & energy summary

Genre/style hints

Arrangement suggestions

Production tips

Simple web-based UI

## 🛠️ Tech Stack (Production-Oriented)

Python

librosa (audio analysis)

NumPy

PyTorch (ML)

scikit-learn (evaluation)

OpenAI-compatible LLM API

Streamlit (UI)
